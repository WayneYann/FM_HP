Note: The following installation instructions install the FlameMaster program 
to ~/FlameMaster and are based on the use of csh, tcsh, or bash. If you are
using a different environment or want to install in a different location
appropriate changes have to be made in the Install script or after
installation. These installation instructions are for LINUX and Mac OSX. Instructions
for windows computers are given below.

0. Pre-install: Before installing the FlameMaster package, the CVODE software needs to be installed.
For this follow the following steps. Go to

https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/download/download.html

and download the cvode tar.gz file and unpack it (Alternatively, you can install the entire 
sundials library, which includes cvode).

Then execute the following commands in the cvode directory. For step 4 you have to know where
cvode was installed.

./configure

make

make install

NOTE: cvode function calls have changed with version 2.6.0 (sundials version 2.4.0). These versions are 
the default in FlameMaster. You can use older versions of cvode (or sundials) by defining an appropriate
environment variable in the file ~/.FlameManExports.csh (or .bash). This is described under step 4.

1.  Rename the FlameMaster archive to ~/FlameMaster  . If you prefer a different location for the
FlameMaster package, rename the FlameMaster folder appropriately and change the path
in FlameManExports.csh or FlameManExports.bash (see installation step 2). The description
below assumes the location to be ~/FlameMaster. If you choose a different location, some
of the commands have to be changed appropriately.

2.  If you are using csh, tcsh, copy the file
~/FlameMaster/FlameManExports.csh to ~/.FlameManExports.csh. If you are using
bash, copy the file ~/FlameMaster/FlameManExports.bash to
~/.FlameManExports.bash

3.  If you are using csh, tcsh, add the line source
~/.FlameManExports.csh to the file ~/.cshrc. If you are using bash,
 add the line source ~/.FlameManExports.bash to the file ~/.bashrc.

4.  Choose the correct settings for flex, cvode, and the computer architecture in the file
~/.FlameManExports.csh or, if you are using bash, in ~/.FlameManExports.bash.
If you are using a cvode version older than 2.6.0 (or the sundials package older than version 2.4.0) 
then set the environment variable FlameManCVODEVERSION to SUNDIALS23. In the csh file this would be
setenv FlameManCVODEVERSION "SUNDIALS23"
In the bash file this would be
export FlameManCVODEVERSION="SUNDIALS23"

5.  Source the file ~/.FlameManExports.csh or ~/.cshrc if you are using csh, or
source the file ~/.FlameManExports.bash or ~/.bashrc. You can do this, for instance,
by executing the command

source ~/.FlameManExports.csh

Instead, you can also log out and in again. It is important to do that in the shell you are using. The
installation script and all other scripts and programs invoked won't recognize
the variables defined in the .FlameManExports.{whateveryouuse} file otherwise.

6. If flex is not installed on the machine and the second flex option in
~/.FlameManExports.{whateveryouuse} has been used, install flex now using the
commands chmod 755 ~/FlameMaster/InstallFlex ~/FlameMaster/InstallFlex

7. Choose the correct machine settings in the file
~/FlameMaster/FlameManTools/ListTool/FLReader/Makefile 

8.  To install the package, use the script Install.csh or Install.bash depending on the shell
you are using. Change the file mode of this script to executable by performing, for instance the command

chmod 755 ~/FlameMaster/Install.csh

9. Install package using the command 

~/FlameMaster/Install.csh

or 

~/FlameMaster/Install.bash
 
depending on your shell. Make sure that your
current shell is newer than installation step 4 or you properly executed step 5.

10. Check out some examples in ~/FlameMaster/FlameManRun. In each directory under
FlameManRun, look at the Readme files, if present. These have descriptions of how
to run the code and pre- and post-process the data. Also some additional helpful 
features are documented in the Readme files. Start with
~/FlameMaster/FlameManRun/Diff/Steady/H2. Then go
to ~/FlameMaster/FlameManRun/Diff/Steady/CH4 and look at the Readme file.
Continue through the other examples.
Note that if the FlameMaster program is not installed in ~/FlameMaster, you have 
to change the path to the mechanism files appropriately in the input files.

For the generation of flamelet libraries, look at the file ~/Documentation/FlameletLibraries.pdf

Another good exercise is to convert the GRI2.11 mechanism from chemkin to
FlameMaster format. This is described in ~/FlameMaster/FlameManTools/CK2FMReinh
in a Readme file.

11. If you come across any problems during the installation, please send me the
complete output of running the FlameMaster install script and relevant results
of just typing the command 'env' and I can try to give you some clues.



Windows computer
To install FlameMaster on windows computers, we use a UNIX type system that first needs to be 
installed on the computer. This system consists of the two packages MinGW and MSYS.  For the 
compilation of the FlameMaster package, the tools flex and bison are also required, which are 
not a part of the MSYS package and need to be installed separately. 

To install these packages, follow these steps:

MinGW
> http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=240780
> Download the .exe and run it
> Install in c:\MinGW
> Select c++ compiler and MinGW make

MSYS
> http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.10.exe
> Download the .exe and run it
> Install in c:\msys\1.0
> Linking with MinGW: use the directory c:\MinGW

MSYS update required for VISTA
> http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=24963
> Download the latest msysCORE tar.gz file.
> Unpack it and copy everything in c:\msys\1.0

flex
> Go in the FlameMaster/flex directory
> ./configure
> make
> make install

bison 
> Go in the FlameMaster/bison directory
> ./configure
> make
> make install


Next the CVODE software needs to be installed.

CVODE
> https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/download/download.html
> Download the tar.gz file and unpack it.
> ./configure
> make
> make install


Finally, the FlameMaster package can be installed. For this follow these steps. For more details
on the installation procedure, follow the steps shown above for LINUX and Mac OSX, but with the 
appropriate files for win32 as listed below. Don't forget the c:/tmp directory.

FlameMaster
> Create a directory named c:/tmp
> Source FlameManExport.win32
> Run Install.win32
